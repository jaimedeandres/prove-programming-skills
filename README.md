# prove-programming-skills

In this GitHub repository, you can find the code to analyze microdata from the Continuous Sample of Working Lives (MCVL) provided by the Spanish Social Security. The code related to the cleaning and aggregation process cannot be published, but a thorough description is included in the PDF file as proof of programming skills. Python was used to clean the raw data, and R was used as the econometric tool.
